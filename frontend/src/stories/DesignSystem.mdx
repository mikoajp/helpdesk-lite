# Design System

Welcome to the **Modern Ticket System Design System**. This design system provides a comprehensive set of design tokens, components, and guidelines to build consistent and beautiful user interfaces.

## Philosophy

Our design system is built on the following principles:

- **Consistency**: Unified visual language across all components
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Modern**: Clean, minimalist aesthetic with subtle animations
- **Flexible**: Highly customizable with design tokens
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast rendering and smooth interactions

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the foundation of our design system. They define the visual primitives such as colors, spacing, typography, and more.

### Key Token Categories

1. **Colors** - Comprehensive color palette with semantic meaning
2. **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
3. **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scale based on 4px units
4. **Border Radius** - Rounded corners for modern aesthetics
5. **Shadows** - Elevation system for depth and hierarchy
6. **Animations** - Smooth transitions and timing functions

## Components

Our component library includes:

- **Priority Badge** - Visual indicators for priority levels
- **Ticket Card** - Card component for displaying ticket information
- **Triage Suggestion Panel** - AI-powered ticket suggestions
- **Header** - Application navigation header
- And more...

## Getting Started

To use components from this design system:

```typescript
import { PriorityBadgeComponent } from '@shared/components';
import { ColorTokens, SpacingTokens } from '@shared/design-tokens';
```

## Color System

Our color system features:

- **Primary Blue** - Modern, trustworthy brand color
- **Semantic Colors** - Success (green), Warning (amber), Error (red), Info (blue)
- **Priority Colors** - Visual hierarchy for ticket priorities
- **Neutral Grays** - Refined grayscale for text and backgrounds

## Typography

We use **Inter** as our primary font family for its excellent readability and modern appearance.

- **Sans-serif** - Inter (default)
- **Monospace** - JetBrains Mono for code
- **Display** - Inter for headings

## Accessibility

All components are designed with accessibility in mind:

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Focus indicators

## Best Practices

1. Always use design tokens instead of hard-coded values
2. Follow the spacing scale for consistent layouts
3. Use semantic color names for better maintainability
4. Test components in both light and dark contexts
5. Ensure all interactive elements have focus states
